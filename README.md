## TSRBench

The **TSRBench** folder contains the curation pipeline for our dataset.
TSRBench consists of two major categories of reasoning tasks: **Scenario-based** and **Knowledge-based**, with 7 subsets in total.

#### Scenario-based Reasoning
| Reasoning Type | Task |
|----------------|------|
| Deductive Reasoning | Anomaly Detection |
| Causal Reasoning | Scenario Attribution |
| Quantitative Reasoning | Inferential Calculation |

#### Knowledge-based Reasoning  
| Reasoning Type | Task |
|----------------|------|
| Inductive Reasoning | CTU (Computer Type Usage) |
| | ECG (Electrocardiogram Record Diagnosis) |
| | EMG (Electromyogram Signal Diagnosis) |
| | RCW (Right Whale Calls Detection) |

We have open-sourced the complete TSRBench dataset on Hugging Face.
