The large, rapid increase (points 148–152) matches rainfall’s transient effect, while the minimal drop (points 152–160) reflects natural post-rain processes.

There are no deviations, trends, or breaks in the data.

The absence of fluctuations is critical because scenarios like fluctuating user demand would likely introduce variability, making these patterns decisive for scenario attribution.  \n\nStep 3 Analyzing time series samples using selected key patterns:  \n[Analysis] The entire series (627 data points) shows no deviation from the constant value of 80.5342.

This pattern directly matches the task’s definition of stability.  \n- **Zero variance**: The absence of fluctuations (variance = 0) confirms the sensor is inactive during maintenance.
